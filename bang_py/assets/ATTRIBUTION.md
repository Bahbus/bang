# Asset Attribution

The character portraits in `characters/` are WebP images generated by
`scripts/generate_assets.py`. The script uses Qt to create simple coloured
placeholders bearing each character's initial. It will re-create any portraits
that are missing.

`scripts/generate_assets.py` also produces short MP3 clips in `audio/` when
real sound effects are absent and can generate basic placeholder PNG images
(such as the card templates) when required. All such generated assets contain
no third-party content and are released under the CC0 license. You may freely
use, modify, and redistribute them. Running the script again only regenerates
assets that are absent. If MP3 encoding is unavailable a WAV fallback is
produced.

The repository includes real MP3 sound effects obtained from the [Kenney Game
Assets library](https://kenney.nl/assets) and released under the CC0 1.0
Universal license. These files replace the previous synthesized placeholders.
The following clips from that collection are bundled:

- `bang.mp3`
- `many_bangs.mp3`
- `indians.mp3`
- `missed.mp3`
- `draw_card.mp3`
- `discard_card.mp3`
- `play_card.mp3`
- `shuffle_cards.mp3`
- `ui_click.mp3`

If you later add new audio or image assets that are not generated by the
script, document the source, creator, and licensing details here.
