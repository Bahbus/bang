# Asset Attribution

The character portraits in `characters/` are WebP images generated by
`scripts/generate_assets.py`. The script uses Qt to create simple coloured
placeholders bearing each character's initial. It will re-create any portraits
that are missing.

`scripts/generate_assets.py` also produces the short WAV clips in `audio/` and
can generate basic placeholder PNG images (such as the card templates) when
required. All such generated assets contain no third-party content and are
released under the CC0 license. You may freely use, modify, and redistribute
them. Running the script again only regenerates assets that are absent.

If you later add new audio or image assets that are not generated by the
script, document the source, creator, and licensing details here.

The files `audio/gunshot.wav`, `audio/card_shuffle.wav`, and `audio/ui_click.wav`
are simple synthesized effects created for this project and released under the
CC0 license.

The icons in `icons/` are sourced from Google's Material Design Icons, which
are licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See https://fonts.google.com/icons
for details.
